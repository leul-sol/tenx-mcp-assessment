## How to submit

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
   - Name it (e.g. `tenx-mcp-assessment` or `Tenx-MCP-Assessment`).
   - Set visibility to **Public**.
   - Do not initialize with a README if you already have one in this folder.

2. **Push this folder to your new repo**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\hp\Tenx-MCP-Assessment
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Tenx MCP Setup Assessment - Tasks 1, 2, 3"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your GitHub username and repo name.

3. **Submit your repository link**
   - Use the public URL, e.g. `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`.

## Tenx MCP connection

Your Tenx MCP connection must be (and was) **active throughout the assessment** so that interactions with your coding agent could be logged automatically. The configuration used is documented in [docs/mcp-config-example.json](docs/mcp-config-example.json) and in [docs/DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).
